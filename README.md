# class-catalog-scraper
A bashed together program which can scrape online class catalogs as long as they are formatted exactly like UCSC's as of summer of 2023. 

Output can be copy pasted into a .dot file for generating a graph with graphviz; I recommend using the svg output type so it include links.
